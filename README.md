# Countries-from-Capital-cities
This repository contains the code along with the data for finding Country name given the name of its Capital city. This has been implemented using word embeddings and cosine similarity</br></br>The user needs to specify the name of a country with it's capital so that the program can figure out the relationship between them and then use that same relationship to find out the desired country name.</br></br> The program takes a while to run on a standard machine because each word embedding is a column vector of 300 rows and we might have around 250 such words.</br></br>Here I have used a predefined set of word embeddings which I have also uploaded as a .p file and imported that in my code.</br></br>The user need to input the name of a country with its capital and the capital city of the country he/she wants to know the name of.</br>Achieved an accuracy of about 92%
